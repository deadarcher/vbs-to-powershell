/**
 * Fail when a SHARED ENGINE FILE has drifted between its copies.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The installer-parsing engine lives byte-identical in more than one repo
 * (the public SwitchHunt tool, the hosted copy on the marketing site, and RFF.Web's deploy
 * wizard). A banner comment at the top of each file asks you to keep them in sync. Banners do
 * not work: measured 2026-07-29, within ONE HOUR of a deliberate sync, installerDetect.ts and
 * burn.ts were both already out of step - in OPPOSITE directions. One had a fix the other
 * lacked, and vice versa. Nobody noticed because nothing was looking.
 *
 * So this looks.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-lib-parity.mjs                     auto-detect sibling checkouts
 *   node scripts/check-lib-parity.mjs <path>              compare against an explicit path
 *   node scripts/check-lib-parity.mjs --require <path>    CI mode - see below
 *
 * --require is MANDATORY IN CI. Without it, three different mishaps all produce a green build
 * that compared nothing:
 *   - the sibling checkout step failed  -> no candidates      -> exit 0 "skipping"
 *   - the path is wrong                 -> every file MISSING -> exit 0 having skipped them all
 *   - someone renames the shared files  -> zero compared      -> exit 0
 * Under --require each of those is a failure. A check that cannot prove it ran must not pass.
 *
 * THIS SCRIPT IS ITSELF A SHARED FILE. It is byte-identical in SwitchHunt, rff-marketing and
 * RFF.Web on purpose, so that any repo can run it and get the right answer without a per-repo
 * fork. It forked once already (2026-09-03: three copies, three behaviours - see SELF_FILES
 * below for what that cost). Sync it like any other shared file.
 *
 * NOT CHECKED: catalog.ts. It legitimately diverges - the marketing copy carries catalogSlug()
 * for its /switchhunt/<slug> routes and the public copy has no such pages. Entry parity there is
 * a different question; compare CATALOG.md counts instead.

/**
 * Which files THIS repo carries, DERIVED from what is on disk rather than hand-declared.
 *
 * This is the fix for the 2026-09-03 incident. Every repo used to keep its own fork of this
 * script with its own hard-coded file list, because the file list differs per repo: SwitchHunt
 * has all five installer modules, RFF.Web has two of them, the tool repos have none. Three
 * forks meant three behaviours, and the two downstream ones rotted - SwitchHunt's still called
 * RFF.Web "planned" and compared this repo against ITSELF (a case-only path mismatch defeated
 * its repoRoot filter), so 5 of its 15 "compared" files were a file diffed against itself.
 *
 * Deriving the local side means one script is correct everywhere, so there is nothing to fork.
 * A candidate's declared groups say what IT holds; intersecting with this says what the pair
 * genuinely share. Anything held by exactly one side of a pair is still a MISSING failure under
 * --require, so this cannot be used to quietly skip a file that ought to be there.
